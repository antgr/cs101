Registration Instructions
-------------------------

1. Ensure you have been added as a developer to the origanisation.
2. Clone this repository onto your laptop and cd into it
3. Add a directory to the student directory with your github name
4. Add two files to the directory:
  1. profile.md
  2. timesheet.txt

profile.md
----------

This file should contain information about your interests
and contact details, eg instagram name, facebook name,
email address, etc. Also add your first language(s) if not
English, and anything else you like but be brief. 

We may establish a more formal format for this file later
so tools can be written to process profile data.

timesheet.txt
-------------

This file should say TIMESHEET at on the first line,
leave a blank line, then put the date, hours, and topic 
in the format

YYYY/MM/DD:01 REGISTRATION
  Today i registered with the school.
  
The next entry will be a follow line.

The timesheet should be used to record activity.
Professional programmers expect to get pay, and bosses
expect to be told what they got for they money.
Keeping a timesheet is the first lesson.

Don't cheat. What you put there is a permanent public record.
You can use it to show you have done real work in the future.
Since most work will involve commits to this repository,
people can check the commit logs and compare with your timesheet.
However some work will involve research and reading.
That counts as work too and should be recorded.

After you have done this, you need to git add the two files,
then push the repository back. We will start with everyone
directly committing to the repository.
